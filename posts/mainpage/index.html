            <p>I've always enjoyed chess, but I've never been a fan of memorizing openings and standard positions. So I decided to create Almost Chess - a mobile game that maintains the core objective of chess while introducing controlled chaos into the mix.</p>

            <h2 id="the-concept">The Concept</h2>
            <p>The game starts with a randomized board layout, with only two rules:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Kings must be in their traditional positions (to maintain some semblance of fairness)</li>
                <li>All other pieces are randomly distributed across the back two ranks</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
            
            <h3 id="multiple-game-modes">Multiple Game Modes</h3>
            <p>The game offers three distinct ways to play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Player</strong>: Battle an AI that's just as confused as you are</li>
                <li><strong>Two Players</strong>: Confuse a friend instead</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Challenge</strong>: A new puzzle each day with limited attempts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="dynamic-ai-difficulty">Dynamic AI Difficulty</h3>
            <p>The AI system uses an ELO rating system that adjusts based on player performance. Each rating tier has its own difficulty settings and random move probability, ranging from Grandmasters (who rarely make random moves) to beginners (who frequently make questionable decisions).</p>

            <h3 id="chess-titles">Chess Titles</h3>
            <p>Players can earn traditional chess titles as they improve their rating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grandmaster (GM): 2500+</li>
                <li>International Master (IM): 2400+</li>
                <li>FIDE Master (FM): 2300+</li>
                <li>Candidate Master (CM): 2200+</li>
                <li>Expert (EX): 2000+</li>
                <li>Class A-F: Below 2000</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="daily-challenges">Daily Challenges</h3>
            <p>The daily challenge mode generates a consistent board layout for all players on a given day using a seeded random number generator. This creates a shared experience where players worldwide tackle the same puzzling position.</p>

            <h2 id="technical-stack">Technical Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Framework</strong>: React Native with Expo</li>
                <li><strong>Language</strong>: TypeScript</li>
                <li><strong>State Management</strong>: React Context</li>
                <li><strong>Storage</strong>: AsyncStorage for game state persistence</li>
                <li><strong>Animations</strong>: React Native Reanimated</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Firebase Auth</li>
                <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Firebase Firestore</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>AI Balance</strong>: Finding the right balance between randomness and strategy for the AI was challenging. Too much randomness made the game feel pointless, while too little defeated the purpose of the "almost" in Almost Chess.</li>
                <li><strong>State Management</strong>: Chess has a lot of state to track - piece positions, valid moves, captured pieces, check status, etc. Using TypeScript helped immensely in managing this complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: Making a game that's intentionally chaotic while still being fun required careful consideration of UI/UX elements like move highlighting and undo functionality.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic container sizing for better small screen support</li>
                <li>Leaderboard implementation</li>
                <li>AI behavior refinements</li>
                <li>Undo move functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h2>
            <p>Almost Chess is available on both iOS and Android:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS: [App Store Link]</li>
                <li>Android: [Play Store Link]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The source code is available on [GitHub Link].</p>

            <p>This project was a fun exploration of game development with React Native, and while it may not improve your chess skills, it might just make you laugh at the absurdity of some positions you end up in!</p>
